# Json - history of changes

This repository contains a single-page application designed to analyze the history of changes to JSON objects. Users can
input JSON objects into a field on the page, either as an array or one by one sequentially. In the results section,
these objects are displayed in the order of input, with lists of fields shown alongside each object indicating those
that have been deleted, added, or modified.

The application is accessible by link https://json-history-of-changes.netlify.app/
